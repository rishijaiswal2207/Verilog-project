This project involves designing a Sequence Detector using a Moore Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog. The goal is to create a circuit that detects a specific binary sequence, in this case, "1011," from a digital input. The output of the FSM will go high only when the desired sequence is detected.The project includes the full Verilog code for implementing the Moore FSM, which describes the behavior and transitions of the FSM based on its current state. The Verilog code specifies the input, output, and internal signals of the FSM, as well as the logic for state transitions and output generation.Additionally, a Verilog Testbench is provided for simulating the Moore FSM sequence detector. The testbench allows for the verification and validation of the FSM's functionality by applying different input sequences and observing the corresponding outputs.In summary, this project aims to design a circuit that functions as a sequence detector using a Moore FSM implemented in Verilog. The FSM detects the binary sequence "1011" and produces an output signal when this sequence is recognized. The Verilog code and testbench provided enable simulation and verification of the FSM's behavior.
